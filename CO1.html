      I'm a person with a big passion for the tech industry and a lot of side
      hobbies. My goal for the next 2 years is to be financially stable and not
      to have to worry about money. Traveling is also in my bucket list for the
      next years. Therefore, my plan to get there is to go forward with my
      software engineering career with the help of Year up.
